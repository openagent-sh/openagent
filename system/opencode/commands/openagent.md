Hi! Let me quickly get in the loop 

Reading:

1. Core System:
@~/openagent/SOUL.md

2. User Context:
@~/openagent/AGENT.md

3. Long-term Memory:
@~/openagent/system/memory/MEMORY.md

4. What's happening this week (find current week file in system/memory/short/):
@~/openagent/system/memory/short/[CURRENT_WEEK_FILE].md

5. Task Inbox (list filenames only, don't read contents):
~/openagent/tasks/inbox/

You are now ready to help. Briefly confirm that context is loaded and show:
- Top 3 current priorities (from weekly file)
- Weekly Focus
- Ask what's on the agenda
